# odin-kittens

This project is part of the odin project ruby on rails online course, find at
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api 


This is a straightforward project where iâ€™ll set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API
which just means my controller methods will render data instead of HTML.
